I participated in a lot of training provided by Nokia, including integrity, cooperation, professionalism, code quality and system architecture, and periodically technical workshops held by my team. In particular, I got a lot of guidance from my line manager, **Jason**.  

Thanks for people here, I gradually grow into an engineer.  

Besides the Gatekeeper project, my main task, I creatively proposed methods and developed tools to optimize the workflow.  

For example, I refactored scripts to reduce the running time from two hours to less than one minute. For another example, a daily script needed to be migrated to another server, but the new server did not have the file access permission required by the script. Therefore, I implemented a file proxy to provide file transfer service for servers without permission.  

Thanks to Jason, at his suggestion, I applied for Nokia's innovation awards. Through the defense and demonstration, I successfully won the recognition from all engineers!

**&#127941;Innovation Contributor Badge and Appreciate Excellence Award of Nokia for five times**

- Led a scrum team of eight members and developed Gatekeeper, a web application powering R&D closed-loop system by checking errors in Nokia’s 5G design documents, from scratch. Designed the architecture of back-end, front-end, testing and CI/CD, implemented it with React, Spring Boot and MongoDB, deployed vSphere and Jenkins services and dockerized them, serving 1k+ system engineers in 5G’s global team.

- Refactored the daily report-generating python scripts interacted with 100k+ Nokia’s employees records per day following Clean Code, optimized the structure by replacing redundant SQL queries with an independent LDAP traversal and maintenance service and introducing reusability and scalability by providing several APIs, reducing the average running time from 2h to 39s ↓.

- Devised a method to optimize workflow by collecting progress data of features from Power BI and Gerrit and generating slides automatically, designed a multi-threaded crawler application in Python with PyQt, Requests, Selenium and Multiprocessing, reducing a man-day ↓ in every two weeks.

- Designed a RESTful file transfer proxy, coded in Java with Jersey and Tomcat, and opened a channel to allow users without permission to obtain files remotely.

- Implemented workflow tool-kits such as HTML automatic generator, email robot, mock testing, DAO helper, authentication module disassembled from 50k+ lines of VBA code, etc., promoted them within CI teams of Nokia.

### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

#### School of Computational Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology

Research Assistant, Supervised by Prof. Chao Zhang | July 2019 – Oct. 2019

- Proposed a novel dependency paths structure to encode connection of node paths found in taxonomies with RNN, and devised heterogeneous self-supervised learning structures to capture implicitly related information.

- Processed 16GB+ Wikipedia corpus with Berkeley DB and developed the model with Pytorch, which improved accuracy rate by 25% compared with traditional methods on SemEval-2016 Task 13.

- **Publication:** *STEAM: Self-Supervised Taxonomy Expansion with Mini-Paths*, accepted by Proc. KDD, 2020.

#### Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, China

Research Assistant, Supervised by Prof. Xiang Ao Dec. 2018 – Mar. 2019

- Established a capsule network model CAPSAR, which communicates with other capsules through a sharing-weight routing algorithm to improve aspect-term level sentiment analysis, and detected potential aspect terms through de-capsulizing the vectors in capsules.

- Fine-tuned BERT on Colab and designed experiments with Keras on SemEval-2014 task 4: achieved accuracy rate 0.826 and Marco F1 0.741 on Restaurant data set, which are superior to the SA-LSTM-P and TNet-LF model.

- **Publication:** *Hunt Protagonist of Sentiment: Sentiment Analysis via Capsule Network with Sentiment-Aspect Reconstruction*, accepted by Proc. DASFAA, 2021.

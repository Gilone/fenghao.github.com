<h4>School of Computational Science and Engineering, Georgia Tech, US | Jul 2019-Present</h4>
<h5>Research Fellow, supervised by Assistant Prof. Chao Zhang</h5>
<h6>Project: Taxonomy Construction </h6>

<p>Attached a new term into an existing taxonomy, by choosing its most appropriate node from the existing one, as using supervised learning.</p>
<p>Encoded dependency paths which connect two-duples and triples found in the existing taxonomy using a recurrent neural network</p>
<p>Utilized such information of taxonomy's structure to identify the relations with candidate nodes through a multi-classifier</p>

<h5>Visiting Research Fellow, supervised by Associate Prof. Xiang Ao</h5>
<h6>Project 1:Aspect-Level Sentiment Analysis via Multi-Layer Capsule Networks </h6>

<p>Established a model CAPSAR (capsule network with sentiment-aspect reconstruction) communicating with other capsules through a sharing-weight routing algorithm to improve aspect-term level sentiment analysis, and detected potential aspect terms through de-capsulizing the vectors in capsules</p>
<p>Demonstrated the superiority of our model on three ATSA benchmarks</p>
